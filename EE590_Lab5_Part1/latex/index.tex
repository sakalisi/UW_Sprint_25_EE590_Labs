This sketch demonstrates Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) scheduling using Free\+RTOS tasks on an ESP32. The program performs three tasks\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Blinks an LED for a total of 500 ms.
\item Displays an incrementing counter on an LCD. in 2 seconds
\item Prints alphabet characters to the serial monitor in 13 seconds. Tasks are managed by a scheduler that resumes them based on the shortest remaining execution time.
